# CPU_Scheduler-simulation
The purpose of this C++ project is to illustrate the differences between various scheduling algorithms based on several different criteria .This project simulates a CPU scheduler with 10,000 randomly generated test processes created from a given max CPU burst time, min CPU burst time, and average inter-arrival time. The user then selects a scheduling algorithm from one of four choices. Those choices being: First in first out, shortest job first, round robin, and priority scheduling. The program then uses that respective algorithm to simulate a CPU scheduler and track the time required in ms. to complete various components of the scheduling. This data is then fed into other algorithms to calculate the total elapsed time, throughput, CPU utilization %, average waiting time, average turnaround time, and average response time.
