Everything works as it should as far as im aware aside
 from a small rounding issue that occurrs sometimes.

test is the name of the input file containing the simulated processes.

The .exe file was giving me trouble on my machine but I think thats 
only an issue with my minGW setup so it should work.

Output goes to the console instead of a file but i included a screenshot of the results of a run.
